# This is a placeholder for favicon.ico
# You'll need to convert the SVG favicon to ICO format
# You can use online tools like:
# - https://favicon.io/favicon-converter/
# - https://realfavicongenerator.net/
# - https://www.favicon-generator.org/

# The favicon should be 16x16, 32x32, and 48x48 pixels
# Based on the SVG design I created with:
# - Gradient background (purple to indigo)
# - Neural network/brain pattern
# - White nodes and connections
# - Professional appearance matching your brand
